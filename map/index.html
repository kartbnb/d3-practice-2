            <br><br>Moreover, In Australia, the eastern coastal city has the dominant number of immigrants compared to the other states. immigrants mainly come from China, India, New Zealand and England. Moreover, immigrants prefer the more developed city. They are more willing to live in the more developed areas like Sydney and Melbourne. It means that the immigrant crowed problem is more rigorous in VIC and NSW.<br><br>On the other hand, based on people's conceptual issues, people from these areas especially India and China are preferring to have more than one kids compared to other countries. In 2017, the fertility rate for India and China is 2.33 and 1.62 (BANK 2017). For Australia, its birth rate in 2017 was 1.765 (BANK 2017), which is similar with China, but still a lot less than the fertility rate in India. Chinese and Indians, even they move to Australia and become part of this country, they were still affecting by their traditional ideas and having higher fertility rates compared with the people who are from the first world. The prediction is immigrant in Australia will keep affecting the population growth especial in VIC and NSW.</section>
